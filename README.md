## General info
We all want to share the things we have with the people we care about, but sometimes it can be difficult to keep track of all our resources.  That's where Lendy comes in.  

Lendy is a lightweight web application that makes it easy for anyone to create a personal inventory of sharable items, keep track of who borrowed them, and know when they are expected back.  With Lendy, your can share your items with confidence, knowing that you won't lose track of your treasures.
